Disaster Relief Coordination Platform

Super Typhoon Yolanda (International Name Haiyan) devastated several cities and towns in the Philippines affecting more than 2 million people and killing at least 2,400. The immediate relief efforts underway have been chaotic and uncoordinated. Essentially, no one knows who's helping which areas, and how they are helping.

BangonPH is a disaster relief coordination platform that collates all the data on relief efforts and publishes it online for all to see. Therefore, individuals can see where help is little or not yet being done, and so they can then respond effectively. It also has an API for developers to tap into its data and even manipulate it.

With the use of this platform and several volunteers, we hope to help guide relief operations nationwide.

This can also be used as a platform for other disasters or calamities that may happen in the future.
